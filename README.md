  ## Music analyzer

  ### Installation
  This project is developed with:
    * `node` version 5.4.1
    * `npm` version 3.5.3

  To install this project run `npm install`.

  If everything works run application by executing `npm run dev`

  ### Testing
  Run `test command` to execute all available test.

  ### Used technologies and techniques
  1. **React.js** - I used this library because in my opinion is one of most elegant ways to decouple view layer from the underlying data model. The component approach makes the app simple in testing and easy to understand for developers and designers.
  2. **Redux** - I user Redux because I believe it fits very well with React. A Clear way of executing actions and managing state changes make it another easy to grasp technology. Similarly to React it makes every bit of code easy to test. Advantages of using this library may not be fully visible at the current stage of project development. I could use React's lifecycle methods to create this simple functionality.
  3. **D3** - One of the most popular tool for creating interactive visual elements in the browser. Because it's not fully compatible with how React manages DOM it requires special wrapping with component and slightly different approach.
  4. **Server side rendering** -

  ### Tools
  1. **ES2016 syntax**
  2. **Webpack**
  3. **Express**

  ### Pros of this choices
  * decoupling view layer from data model
  * high modularity
  * easy to implement state changes
  * testability
  * accessibility

  ### Cons
  * not production ready
  * requires managing both client and server side

  ### Future improvements
